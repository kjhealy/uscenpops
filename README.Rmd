This package provides a single dataset of censal and intercensal population estimates for the United States by year of age and sex, for every year from 1900 to 2019. 

## Installation

`uscenpops` is a data package. 

### Install direct from GitHub

You can install the beta version of uscenpops from [GitHub](https://github.com/kjhealy/uscenpops) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("kjhealy/uscenpops")
```

### Installation using `drat`

While using `install_github()` works just fine, it would be nicer to be able to just type `install.packages("uscenpops")` or `update.packages("uscenpops")` in the ordinary way. We can do this using Dirk Eddelbuettel's [drat](http://eddelbuettel.github.io/drat/DratForPackageUsers.html) package. Drat provides a convenient way to make R aware of package repositories other than CRAN.

First, install `drat`:

```{r drat, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("drat")) {
    install.packages("drat")
    library("drat")
}
```

Then use `drat` to tell R about the repository where `uscenpops` is hosted:

```{r drat-uscenpops}
drat::addRepo("kjhealy")
```

You can now install `uscenpops`:

```{r uscenpops-drat, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("uscenpops")
```

To ensure that the `uscenpops` repository is always available, you can add the following line to your `.Rprofile` or `.Rprofile.site` file:

```{r rprofile}
drat::addRepo("kjhealy")
```

With that in place you'll be able to do `install.packages("uscenpops")` or `update.packages("uscenpops")` and have everything work as you'd expect. 

Note that the drat repository only contains data packages that are not on CRAN, so you will never be in danger of grabbing the wrong version of any other package.


## Loading the data

The package works best with the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) libraries.

```{r libs}
library(tidyverse)
```

Load the data:

```{r load}
library(uscenpops)
```

```{r uscenpops}
uscenpops
```

## Example


```{r example-1}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

pop_pyr <- uscenpops %>% select(year, age, male, female) %>%
  pivot_longer(male:female, names_to = "group", values_to = "count") %>%
  group_by(year, group) %>%
  mutate(total = sum(count), 
         pct = (count/total)*100, 
         base = 0) 

pop_pyr

```

```{r example-2, fig.height = 10, fig.width = 10, dpi = 300}

## Axis labels
mbreaks <- c("1M", "2M", "3M")

## colors
pop_colors <- c("#E69F00", "#0072B2")

## In-plot year labels
dat_text <- data.frame(
  label =  c(seq(1900, 2015, 5), 2019),
  year  =  c(seq(1900, 2015, 5), 2019),
  age = rep(95, 25), 
  count = rep(-2.75e6, 25)
)

pop_pyr$count[pop_pyr$group == "male"] <- -pop_pyr$count[pop_pyr$group == "male"]

p <- pop_pyr %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(seq(1900, 2015, 5), 2019)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = age, ymin = base,
                       ymax = count, fill = group))

                     breaks = seq(-3e6, 3e6, 1e6), 
                     limits = c(-3e6, 3e6)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(10, 100, 10)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = pop_colors, labels = c("Females", "Males")) + 
  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Population in Millions",
       title = "Age Distribution of the U.S. Population, 1900-2019",
       subtitle = "Age is top-coded at 75 until 1939, at 85 until 1979, and at 100 since then",
       caption = "Kieran Healy / kieranhealy.org / Data: US Census Bureau.",
       fill = "") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        plot.title = element_text(size = rel(2), face = "bold"),
        strip.background = element_blank(),  
        strip.text.x = element_blank()) +
  coord_flip() + 
  facet_wrap(~ year, ncol = 5)

## Source

The data are sourced from the [US Census Bureau](http://census.gov), from the residential estimates available in various formats and spans at <https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/>. In any year where multiple months were available, the July estimate was used.
